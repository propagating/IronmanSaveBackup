# IronmanSaveBackup

This project is designed to be a tool for creating automatic backups, and restoring those backups, of Ironman save games.

It's initial purpose is the protection of XCOM 2 save games (working with any version of the game), as Ironman tends to cause unrecoverable crashes and heartache for many players.

The tool is built to work with any game that has ironman saves, though that functionality will not be fully tested and integrated for the time being. If the game uses a similar naming scheme to XCOM 2 (meaning it has the word IRONMAN in the save and there is only 1 save per campaign) then there should be no problems using this tool for that game as well.

This tool is NOT intended to be used for save scumming, and you may run into issues trying to use it as such. This is done for two reasons: 1) it's against the spirit of ironman and 2) It's much more difficult to restore a backup from a bad action through this tool than it is just to play non-ironman.

EDIT: Initially I was concerned about the possibility of making save corruption worse with this tool, however as the save process seems to relatively straightforward and sandboxed, that realistically won't be an issue.
